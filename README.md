### Hello everyone! I'm Thales Medeiros, I'm a programming student. 

&nbsp;

### This is my E-commerce project for Gama_Vtex Challenge 2

&nbsp;

#### In this project:

- 3 Pages
- 2 input email
- 1 Form

&nbsp;

    Page 1 - index.html

    This page will have 1 header, 1 nav, 1 main, 3 div-content, 1 div-product and 1 footer.

    - As soon as you open the index.html page, after 5 seconds a promotion card appears for you to register your email, where you can enter your email and send or close this card on X

    - When you close the promotion cart you will be able to interact with the page, in the products div you can click buy now and you will be directed to the cart page

    - In the footer you will see access links for each category of service, you will also have the social networks, and another email input to receive news with a button that sends the email to the localstorage.

&nbsp;

    Page 2 - carrinho.html

    This page will have 1 header, 1 nav, 1 main and 1 footer.

    - In Main it will show the Item information that when the user clicks the button of the respective item, the code takes the id of the item that calls the id of the parent div and then calls the class or Id of the child and that way I create an object and place the item values ​​in this object and send it to the localstorage, and I request this object on this page and add the object values ​​in Main that shows the information, in addition, it will have a button to complete the purchase that when clicked will redirect to the page of user registration to complete the purchase.

    - In the footer you will see access links for each category of service, you will also have the social networks, and another email input to receive news with a button that sends the email to the localstorage.

&nbsp;

    Page 3 - cadastro.html

    This page will have 1 header, 1 nav, 1 main and 1 footer.

    - In Main you will have a small registration form to complete the purchase of the selected item. The form is very iterative, and in the case of an empty field, an alert will be triggered with the message "Fill the field correctly", with all fields filled, when clicking the "send" button the code creates a client object that receives the information of the form, this object is saved in the storage location and triggers an alert with the message "Order successfully placed and that the user will receive the order information by e-mail and then be redirected to the index.html page

    - In the footer you will see access links for each category of service, you will also have the social networks, and another email input to receive news with a button that sends the email to the localstorage.
